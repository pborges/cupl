# cupl

**WARNING** This compiler was developed entirely through blackbox testing — comparing input `.pld` files against expected `.jed` output files. It has not been validated against the WinCUPL source or specification beyond these test cases and may not be ready for production use.

A minimal, cross-platform CLI to compile WinCUPL `.pld` files into JEDEC (`.jed`) programming files for PAL/GAL devices.

WinCUPL is Windows-only and long out of date. This project aims to provide a modern replacement focused on:

- A **small, dependency-light** Go codebase
- A **clean CLI** for batch-friendly workflows
- **Deterministic output** suitable for programming PAL/GAL devices

## Status

Working MVP:

- Parses a practical CUPL subset
- Supports `g16v8` and `g22v10`
- Generates JEDEC with checksums
- Quine-McCluskey product term minimization
- Blackbox tested against real-world PLD/JED samples

## Limitations

- Not full WinCUPL parity yet
- Focused on logic equations used in the sample designs
- Limited device support (GAL16V8/22V10 variants only)

## Features

- WinCUPL-style `.pld` input to JEDEC `.jed` output
- Deterministic JEDEC generation with checksums
- Device support: `g16v8`, `g22v10`
- Batch-friendly CLI (`build`, `burn`, `devices`, `version`, `-v`)
- Blackbox tested against real-world PLD/JED samples
- Small, dependency-light Go codebase

## Non-goals (initially)

- GUI tooling
- IDE integration
- Full WinCUPL feature parity on day one

## CLI

```bash
# Compile PLD into JEDEC
cupl build path/to/design.pld -o path/to/design.jed

# Burn JEDEC to device with minipro (device auto-detected from JED header)
cupl burn path/to/design.jed

# Or burn directly from a PLD (builds a temp JED first)
cupl burn path/to/design.pld

# Override minipro device name
cupl burn path/to/design.jed -p g16v8as

# Show device info or list supported devices
cupl devices

# Show version
cupl -v
```

## Build And Test

```bash
go build ./cmd/cupl
go test ./...
```
